# WWU Sumerian NLP

## Purpose 
We build tools to aid in the processing and analysis of ancient Sumerian tablets. 

we have built a no-code dashboard that utilizes our open source libraries to let Assyriologists automate their workflow.

We demonstrate how our libraries and dashboard can be used to create knowledge graphs.
